        <p>Dear Ram Prasad,</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It is my pleasure to strongly recommend Aashna Singhania for the Jr.
          Data Analyst role with Clouddatanow Tech. I am Roshni Duttaa, a
          project manager at Asomtech Solutions. I have 12 years of experience
          working in the tech industry and have seen many young professionals
          come and go. Ms. Singhania is one individual I have worked with who
          uniquely stands out.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          During our time together, Aashna displayed great talents in data
          analytics. When we first met, I was immediately impressed with Aashna
          but during the time we worked together, her understanding of analysing
          data to achieve results for our company grew far more than that of her
          peers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you need more information or specific examples, please do not
          hesitate to contact me at 050 2948 2948. As a recommendation letter
          likely only provides a snapshot of her talents and achievements, I
          would be happy to further elaborate on my time working with her.
        </p>
        <br />
