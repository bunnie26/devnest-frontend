    <p>Ram Prasad<br>Sr. Data Analyst<br>Clouddatanow Tech<br>101 Solanki Street<br>Kanchan marg, Kolkata, West Bengal<br></p>
    <p>Dear Ram Prasad,</p>
    <p>It is my pleasure to strongly recommend Aashna Singhania for the Jr. Data Analyst role with Clouddatanow Tech. I am<br>Roshni Duttaa, a project manager at Asomtech Solutions. I have 12 years of experience working in the tech industry and<br>have seen many young professionals come and go. Ms. Singhania is one individual I have worked with who uniquely stands out.</p>
    <p>During our time together, Aashna displayed great talents in data analytics. When we first met, I was immediately impressed<br>with Aashna but during the time we worked together, her understanding of analysing data to achieve results for our company<br>grew far more than that of her peers.</p>
    <p>It’s not just her technical skills that impress me. Aashna was a joy to work with because of her amazingly positive attitude and<br>ability to communicate across teams. Her focus and attention to detail were also necessary and valued not just by me but<br>also by her peers who often relied on her to get the job done.</p>
    <p>I am absolutely confident that Aashna would be a great fit at Clouddatanow Tech. Not only will she bring the kind of skills and<br>experiences you’re looking for in an applicant, she will quickly become an asset and help your company grow in any way she can.</p>
    <p>If you need more information or specific examples, please do not hesitate to contact me at 050 2948 2948. As a<br>recommendation letter likely only provides a snapshot of her talents and achievements, I would be happy to further elaborate<br>on my time working with her.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,<br>Vinay Lakhani<br>Sr. Project Manager<br></p>
